       <h1>The other name for Chak 72/10-R</h1>
        <p> The 16th day of April in 1853 is special in the Indian history.
            The day was a public holiday. At 3:30 pm, as the 21 guns roared together,
            the first train carrying Lady Falkland, wife of Governor of Bombay,
            along with 400 special invitees, steamed off from Bombay to Thane.

            Ever since the engine rolled off the tracks,
            there have been new dimensions to the distances, relations and emotions.
            Abaseen Express, Khyber Mail and Calcutta Mail were not just
            the names of the trains but the experiences of hearts and souls.
            Now that we live in the days of burnt and non functional trains,
            I still have a few pleasant memories associated with train travels.
            These memoirs are the dialogues I had with myself while sitting
            by the windows or standing at the door as the train moved on.
            In the era of Cloud and <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> communications,
            I hope you will like them.</p>
